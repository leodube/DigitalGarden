### Spells
#### Concentration
Some spells and other effects require Concentration to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. If the effect's creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect's description specifies how long the creator can concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.
***Another Concentration Effect***. You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.
***Damage***. lf you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30.
***lncapacitated or Dead***. Your Concentration ends if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.

###### Minor Illusion
*Illusion*
**Casting Time**: Action
**Range**: 30 feet
**Components**: S, M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration**: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.
If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
**Sound**. lf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
**lmage**. If you create an image of an object - such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest - it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 50 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.

###### Find Familiar (conjuration, ritual)
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: Bat, Cat, Frog, Hawk, Lizard, Octopus, Owl, Rat, Raven, Spider, Weasel, or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form (see appendix B, 2024), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.
***Telepathic Connection***. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.
***Combat***. The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
***Disappearance of the Familiar***. When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.
***One Familiar Only***. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.

> Note: Owls don't provoke opportunity attacks

###### Blur (illusion, concentration)
Your body becomes blurred. For the duration, any creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it per-ceives you with Blindsight or Truesight.

###### Hold Person (enchantment, concentration)
Choose a Humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Paralyzed condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot***. You can target one additional Humanoid for each spell slot level above 2.

---
###### Mirror Image (illusion)
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.
Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.

---
###### Shatter (evocation)
A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save.
A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell SIot***. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
