### Spells
#### Concentration
Some spells and other effects require Concentration to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. If the effect's creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect's description specifies how long the creator can concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.
***Another Concentration Effect***. You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.
***Damage***. lf you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30.
***lncapacitated or Dead***. Your Concentration ends if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.

##### 1st Level
###### Alarm (abjuration, ritual)
You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:
***Audible Alarm***. The alarm produces the sound of
a handbell for 10 seconds within 6O feet of the
warded area.

if you are within l mile of the warded area. This
ping awakens you if you're asleep.

###### Find Familiar (conjuration, ritual)
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: Bat, Cat, Frog, Hawk, Lizard, Octopus, Owl, Rat, Raven, Spider, Weasel, or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form (see appendix B, 2024), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.
***Telepathic Connection***. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.
***Combat***. The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
***Disappearance of the Familiar***. When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.
***One Familiar Only***. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.

An imperceptible barrier of magical force protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from Magic Missile.

###### Witch Bolt (evocation, concentration)
A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 Lightning damage.
On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a Bonus Action to deal 1d12 Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed.

###### Mirror Image (illusion)
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.
Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.
###### Shatter (evocation)
A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save.
A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.
***Using a Higher-Level Spell SIot***. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
