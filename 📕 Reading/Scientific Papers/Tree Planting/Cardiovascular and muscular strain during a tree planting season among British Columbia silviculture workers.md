## Interesting Points
- Injury statistics indicate the annual risk of injury to a planter is as high as 75% in accidents which often incur multiple injuries.
- A study found that subjects adjusted their walking pace at a constant energy output of $425 kcal/hr \pm 10$% to accommodate imperceptibly varying treadmill speeds. This suggests that individuals adjust their rate of work in order to maintain a constant work output (work pace) in the presence of a changing task load.
- A study compared productivity between groups of Ontario silviculture workers paid either an hourly wage or on a piecework basis. Not surprisingly hourly paid planters spent nearly twice as much time on non-productive activities (26.1%) compared to those on piece-rate (12%).
- Payment by a piecework rate is favoured practice among tree-planting workers. In a report in which 115 planters were surveyed, only one individual complained about the piece-work system of payment.
