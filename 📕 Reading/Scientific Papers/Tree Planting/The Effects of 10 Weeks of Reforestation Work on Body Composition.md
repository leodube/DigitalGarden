>**Objective** - To document changes in body composition and body mass in male and female tree planters.
>
>**Methods** - Height, mass, skin-fold thickness, and limb girths were measured in 17 male and 5 female tree planters before and after 10 weeks of work.
>
>**Results** - Significant decreases were found in body mass (80.6 Â± 10.7 kg vs 76.8 Â± 8.5 kg) and body fat (13.3% Â± 5.5% vs. 10.4% Â± 5.0%) in the men (P < .05). No changes in skin-foldâ€“corrected limb girths were found in the men or women. Initial body mass was significantly (P < .05) correlated with mass loss in men (r2 < .46) and women (r2 < .67). Estimated daily energy consumption was 20680.1 Â± 2204.5 kJ for men and 14516.6 Â± 2077.3 kJ for women, and estimated daily fat consumption was 194.2 Â± 30.1 g for men and 132.3 Â± 35.6 g for women.
>
>**Conclusions** - Ten weeks of tree planting leads to significant decreases in body mass and body fat in men while maintaining skin-foldâ€“corrected limb girths.

## Introduction
- The majority of a 7-9 hour tree planting work day is spent at between 60% and 75% of maximal heart rate. ([[ðŸ“• Reading/Scientific Papers/Tree Planting/In-Season Physiological and Biochemical Status of Reforestation Workers|See More]])

## Methods
### Subjects
A total of 17 male and 5 female subjects volunteered for the study. Of the men, 9 had a mean of 1.6 seasons of previous tree-planting experience and 8 had no previous experience. Of the women, only 1 had previous experience in the industry (for 2 seasons).

## Results
- Men experienced significant decreases in body fat and body mass. The women experienced no significant changes in body fat or body mass.

>[!attention]
>They found similar decreases in the female subject but could not achieve statistical significance due to the small sample size (N=5)

- For the days on which nutritional data were collected, mean energy consumption for was $4942.6 \pm 526.8 kcal$ for the men and $3469.4 \pm 496.4 kcal$ for the women.
- On average, the male subjects lost approximately 55g of body mass per day.
