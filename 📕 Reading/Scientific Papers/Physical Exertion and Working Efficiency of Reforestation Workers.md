>[!abstract]
>**Background**: The purpose of this study was to quantify the physical exertion during tree planting work and to examine the relationships between exertion, task efficiency, and productivity.
>
>**Methods**: Heart rate (HR) was monitored on 34 tree planters while they worked. HR data was collected for a complete working day on 19 subjects and for shorter periods of time on 15 subjects. Video of work tasks was recorded on 22 subjects (video was recorded on 7 of the subjects for whom HR was monitored through a full working day) and analyzed for working pace and proportion of time spent on each task.
>
>**Results**: HR during a full day (9.0 ± 1.2 hours) of tree planting work was 115.2 ± 8.8 beats.min-1, and working HR was 128.2 ± 15.6 beats.min-1 for 82.5 ± 6.8% of the work day. Mean work pace was 452 ± 174 trees.h-1, and the proportion of time spent planting each tree was 53 ± 8% of the working time. Significant (P < 0.05) positive correlations were found between work pace and experience level, and between work pace and working HR, and a significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation was found between experience level and HR for a given work pace. No significant relationships were found between experience level or work pace and the proportion of time spent planting each tree.
>
>**Conclusions**: Tree planters work at approximately 65% of age-predicted HRmax, and maintain HR at approximately 59% of HRmax throughout the entire working day. Productivity in these workers appears to be related to effort rather than to experience or task efficiency per se.


## Background
- Canada's forests account for 27% of the country's land mass.
- Forestry is worth $6 billion per annum.
- Workers carried loads of approximately 17 kg for distances of 16 km per day with an average heart rate (HR) of 60%-75% of maximal heart rate ($HR_{max}$).

## Methods
The most interesting part of the methods section is the *video-recording & analysis*, and the *data & statistical analyses*.

>[!note]
> Data collection occurred in the middle of a reforestation season (June and July) to avoid making measures on workers who were still learning tasks.

### Video-Recording & Analysis
- Subjects were video-recorded during three minutes of tree panting work. Each subject was filmed on three separate occasions to ensure consistency of the data captured by video.
- The analysis was performed manually by a researcher with 16 years of tree planting experience by recording the total time spent planting each tree, the total number of trees planted, and the total time spent walking between each tree. Time spent planting each tree was defined as the time between the point at which the worker stopped walking and had clearly selected a microsite and the point at which they closed the earth around the tree seedling and began walking again.

>[!question]
> Does this study take into account time spent between bagups (i.e. at cache or walking to cache)?
>
> **Answer**: Yes and no. For some calculations such as **work pace** it does not factor in breaks.

### Data & Statistical Analyses
- **Mean HR** for a full working day was calculated as the average HR throughout the entire work day (including breaks in work).
- **Working HR** was defined as the mean HR recorded during the process of planting trees (as opposed to mean HR inclusive of all activities during the work day), and was calculated by including only the data recorded during the three minutes of video recording.
- **Work pace** was defined as the number of trees planted per hour. This was calculated by summing the number of trees planted in the three minute video sample of work to the nearest tree and multiplying by 20.
- **Efficiency** was defined as the quotient of HR divided by the working pace, with a lower quotient indicating a higher efficiency.

>[!question]
>Are there potential implications to calculating the pace and efficiency using a 3 minute sample rather than taking the number of trees planted in the day?

## Results
- For subjects on whom a full day HR data was collected, the proportion of time during each day spent at the working HR ranged from $71 - 94$% of the work day (mean $83 \pm 7$%)

>[!note]
>The time spent planting vs on break could be quite a significant factor affecting a tree planter's total daily production.

- The mean proportion of working time spent planting each tree was $53 \pm 8$%. 
- The more tree planting experience you have, the faster your work pace.
- The faster your work pace, the higher your working HR.

**This next part is the most interesting aspect of the study, in my opinion:**
- No significant relationship was found between the proportion of time spent planting each tree and experience level, or the proportion of time spent planting each tree and work pace.
