>Tree-planting demands sustained high work-output and is associated with high injury rates but has not been characterized previously. Data were collected from 10 male planters after 19  5 (T1) and 37  5 days (T2) of planting. One severe infection and one knee strain injury were noted. Loads carried were 32%  5% body mass and heart rates were between 60% to 75% of maximum for 57%  26% of the planting shift. A loss of 1.7%  1.5% body mass occurred, although intake exceeded 5000 kcal/day.

## Introduction
- The strenuous nature of tree planting has been shown to load to immunosuppression, with a reduced ability of the immune system to effect tissue repairs after injury or to ward off infections when exposed to pathological organisms.
- This project proposed to characterize the occupation of tree-planting by determining fitness, dietary intake, blood glucose, body composition, and markers of inflammation, immune, and neoroendocrine systems as affected by the work of tree-planting.

## Results
- Three-day diet history analysis indicated that the mean caloric intake was $5159 \pm 1047$ kcal/day, of which $14 \pm 3$% was protein, $50 \pm 7$% was protein, $35 \pm 7$% was fat.

## Discussion
- The most pronounced finding was that blood glucose levels remained at near hypoglycemic levels throughout the day.
- Muscle wasting in response to increased cortisol levels is well documented. In the current study, planters lost an average of $1.7 \pm 1.5$% of body mass over 14 days. Skinfold measurements indicated that approximately 15% of this loss was due to loss of fat mass, with the remainder of the loss due to loss of lean muscle mass.
- Sports science has clearly demonstrated the benefits of increased carbohydrate intake on both the duration of and intensity sustained during endurance performance. These effects are particularly pronounced when carbohydrates are supplemented during exercise.
- Recovery from prolonged exercise has been shown to be significantly improved by the provision of high glycemic-index intake in the postexercise period.
